  How To Play The Lab
---

**Setup**
<br />    
Arrange the pieces as shown below.
![Diagram](/sliders-diagram-setup.png)
<br />
The **8** path pieces represent the discs that will pave the way for the fuel.    
The **3** slider pieces are the precious vials of fuel.    
Place the 3 corresponding slider pieces off the edge of the board.     
<br /> 
**Rules**
   
- Randomly select the first player.    
- On each turn, a player must move a path piece and then a slider piece.    
- A path piece can move 1 space in any direction.    
- A path piece can also make a leap move where it can jump over any single piece (either color) in any direction (orthogonal or diagonal) to an empty space.  Multiple jumps are allowed as long as there are empty spaces connecting the jumps.

- A slider piece that is off the board can move onto any square that contains a path piece in the last row closest to the player.  

- A slider piece on the board can move freely across the board (like a queen in chess) as long as there are path pieces on the squares.  It does not matter if the path pieces belong to the opponent.

- Slider pieces can not move onto squares without path pieces.
- Sliders can not move through any other slider pieces.
- A path piece can not jump over any other path piece with a slider on it.
- If a player moves their slider piece into one of the opponent's corner square, the piece is removed from the board and one of the vials of fuel has successfully left the lab.

**The first player to escape with all 3 vials of fuel wins.**    
(i.e. move all their slider pieces off the board)
    
If a player is unable to move a piece (either path or slider), the opponent wins.
