  Prologue

The Ancients said this day would come.    

<br />
No one knows exactly how they were able to foresee this future, but they knew life on the planet of Xolo would not last forever.  Xolo’s inner core has been slowly collapsing for thousands of years.  In preparation, the Ancients constructed a great portal in the sky and left behind instructions in their ancient text.  The text told future generations to construct a ship large enough to house the entire population.  This city-sized vessel would require a special fuel made with rare minerals found on the planet’s surface.  Just a small amount could launch a massive ship upwards towards the portal escaping out of this dying planet.    
        
<br />
Unfortunately, since the Ancient days, the people of Xolo became divided.  The House of Jathum built a great pyramid ship.  The House of Norn built an equally splendid ship in the shape of a dome.  A civil war that never ended ensued and the text to the fuel formula was destroyed. 
            
<br /> 
The two houses rarely interacted with each other except in a lab where generations of scientists from both houses worked.  Both sides hope that together they can discover the right mixture of minerals that would produce the fuel.  Launching their ships into the portal was the only hope they had to save their people.
